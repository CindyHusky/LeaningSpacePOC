# liquid data matrix
The learning space or liquid data matrix allows ai to take in and understand arbitrary data by mimicing the thalamus in function using a liquid data vector
which could allow for agi like capabilities

i used ai to make the program yes(deepseek and gpt)
but i came up with the concept when i misunderstood how lnns work either that or it was a dream- i dont fully know..

its liquid data matrix that perceptrons encode and infer arbitrary data from any form of structured input/s in existance

it is to my knowledge nobody has tried this
