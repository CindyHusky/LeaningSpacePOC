# LeaningSpacePOC
it allows ai to take in and understand arbitrary data by mimicing the thalamus in function


i used ai to make the program yes(deepseek and gpt)
but i came up with the concept when i misunderstood how lnns work either that or it was a dream- i dont fully know
this model feeds perceptron(psudo neuron) outputs into a vector or grayscale image then having reader perceptrons infer the meaning behind the vector, with this and back propagation you can teach it to do anything, i fed raw video data into one but i fucked the code a bit see visual data poc.py (*warning it is gonna flashbang you with a really big window*)
i invented this technique so you have to call it a learning space
its a space that the model stores learned data in
it acts as a psudo thalamus able to take in multiple forms of arbitrary data at once in theory so far i only have video though


it is to my knowledge nobody has tried this
